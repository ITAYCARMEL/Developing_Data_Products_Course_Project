## Covid19 spread rate apliccation



This is an Introduction (Executive Summary) to my final project in **Developing Data Products** course.

We all experience strange time these days while the Covid19 epidemic continue to hit and kill Thousands of victims every day.

The Data Sience world harrnesses all the knowledge and practical tools it has to help in the shared effort of fighting the virus.

With **Covid19 spreading rate comparison application** we hope to make our modest contribution to that effort by enabling a clear and easy way to compare the virus spreading rate between countries all over the world.

## What it does:

The application presents a graph of confirmed cases within the selected countries (one or many) for certain date range, define by the user.

## The Data Source(part 1):

The dataset Behind the Scenes comes from "Our World In Data" [Website](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data).

The original data format is a bit messy and there are some cleaning and redesigning work needed to be done.

Here is the original:
```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

library(tidyr)

# download the dataset file

  url<-"https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/ecdc/total_cases.csv"

  dest<-"../Covid19_spread_rate/total_cases.csv"

  download.file(url,dest)

  
# read in the file
  
  mydata<-read.csv("total_cases.csv",stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
data_dim<-dim(mydata)
  head(mydata,5)
```

## The Data Source (part 2):

As we can see in this dataset, the variables(columns) are the countries and the date while the observations(rows) are the sum of cases per day.

In order to enable more conviniet structure we had to transform the shape of the dataset: 
```{r,echo=FALSE}

# prepare the data: 
    cnms<-colnames(mydata)
    cnms<-cnms[2:208]
  
#reshape the data
    mydata<-gather(mydata,cnms,key="Country",value="Cases")
  
# Remove unnecessary dots in the country names:
    mydata$Country<-gsub("\\."," ",mydata$Country)

# remove the NA
    mydata$Cases[is.na(mydata$Cases)]<-0

# convert the date variable from factor to Date
    mydata$date<-as.Date(mydata$date)
    head(mydata)
  
```
 
 This format make it easy for the application to plot the comparison graph.
